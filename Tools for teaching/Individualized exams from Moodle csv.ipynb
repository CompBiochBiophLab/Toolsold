    "This is simple system to generate specific tests for the students. You need two files: \n",
    "* `courseid_22740_participants.csv`: a CSV file containing the names and e-mails of the students (obtained from Moodle): the caolumns should be named `First name`, `Surname` and Èmail address`\n",
    "* `test.csv`: a CSV file containinf the questions, in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "Points  |  Question   |  data1 \n",
    "\n",
    "within the`Question` you may use the replacement tag `XXX`, that will be substituted by the info that is under `data1`. It should be straighforward to add a data2 and a second tag, let's say, `YYY`. `data1` should contain a comma separated list of possible substitutions for `XXX`.\n",

    "Improvements needed:\n",
    "* to allow for random selection of the `data1` elements, in order to allow for shorter list of elements. Currently you need at least the same number of `data1` options than elements are in the student's list.\n",
    "* files are created in a given folder, assuming google drive, and links are created ina  file called `links.txt`. It should be possible to generate a list of e-mails for each file without expecting the students to ask for permissions to check their files.\n"
